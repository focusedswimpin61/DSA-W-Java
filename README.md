# DSA in Java – A Comprehensive Learning Journey

# DSA in Java - Personal Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. This repository is solely for my own use, acting as a digital notebook where I store and review my Java code implementations for various DSA challenges. The focus here is on building and refining my coding skills through direct practice rather than creating extensive documentation or learning notes.

## What’s Inside

This collection is organized by topics and the types of data structures or algorithms tackled. Each folder contains pure code files dedicated to specific challenges or subjects. The repository includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:

- **Arrays and Strings:** Basic manipulation, searching, and sorting techniques.
- **Linked Lists:** Implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Classic implementations and variations, including priority queues.
- **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees, and other tree structures with traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs:** Basic graph representations, DFS/BFS algorithms, and other graph-related implementations.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms, search algorithms, recursion-based solutions, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

## Repository Organization

Since this repository is intended for personal reference, the emphasis is on maintaining clear, working code that I can revisit later for review or further improvements. I am not including additional notes or detailed explanations beyond essential inline comments, keeping the focus strictly on code functionality and structure.

## How to Use

- **Cloning:** Simply clone the repository to your local machine to explore or execute the Java files directly.
- **Execution:** Navigate to the specific folder you’re interested in, compile the Java files, and run them using your preferred development environment.
- **Review and Refresh:** Use this as a tool to periodically review my implementations and assess improvements in efficiency and design as I grow in my coding journey.

## Final Thoughts

This repository functions as a personal code library. Every commit represents progress and a snapshot of my understanding at that moment. It’s a work in progress that evolves with each new challenge encountered. For now, it remains a private workspace where I track and fine-tune my practical skills in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.
